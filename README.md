# Greg's Portfolio

## Description
The purpose of this webpage was to create a place where my projects can be showcased and all be held in one place.This is important becasue it allows for me to acces all of them at once since each photo has a link to one the deployed pages. Throughtout this procces one of the main goaLs was to create a webpage that not only has all of the projects that have been completed on it but its all accesiable but the use of other devices like a smart phone or table. understanding how all these features coresponed together was probably the hardest part of this project. But with that there was so much that i was abkle to learn and groew my knowlage even further.

Their are a couple features that  this webpage has, the first being that you are able to go to each of the sections with just a click of a button on the nav bar at the topof the page. Along with this you are able to access the deployed page by just clicking the name under the photo in the box. One of the last but most important features of this webpage is that it is able to be sized down to either fit a tablets screen along with a smart phones screen.
