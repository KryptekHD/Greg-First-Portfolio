                    Hello my name is Greg DeCarlo and I was born and raised in a small town located in connecticut. I had previously lived there all of my life untill the summer of 2022 where I up rooted
                   and moved across the country to los anagles. While I was growing up I did a lot of things that shaped me to who I am today and the person I have become. One of these things was sports,
                   I played them all throughout elementry, middle school, highschool, and collage and they have been a huge part of who I am today. I think this because the have tought me the importance
                   of having strong goals and a team that has your back.
               </p>
               <p>
                   There has always been one thing that i have alwasy been interested in for as long as i could rember and that was the web and all the different things that yu were able to do 
                   on it and how it can help or change so many lives. so when to chance came to learn how to create these tyoes of pages I jumped on it.
